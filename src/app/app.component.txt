1. introduction to jasmine and karma

jasmine is bdd(behavious driven development)
it is tesing framework for angular for unit testing
karma is open source automation testing tool

2. flow of angular unit test case

app.component.spec.ts -> file we write our test cases
describe -- is the test suite for particular component
it -- is the particular test case inside the component
testBed and async
jasmine give us the asynchronous functinality via async
testBed is main utility inside the angular.
beforeEach -- run before any block
describe first runs -- beforeEach runs -- lastly it runs

3. how to run the angular unit test cases

describe -- tells the jasmine on which component unit testing will be performed
beforeEach -- tells the jasmine to run give code before anything
testBed -- setup the configuration and initialize the favourable condition for testing
configureTestingModule -- setup the module that allows us to test our test case
declaration -- component which is to tested and also the who dependency on component like child component
provider -- override the actual servide using the spy
imports -- are the api we used inside the component like formsmodule for ngmodel etc.
ng test -- to run the test
for particular folder ng test --include /path
